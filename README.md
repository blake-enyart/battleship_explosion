Battleship Explosion

Overview:

Battleship explosion is a collaborative project created by Blake Enyart and Rob Stringer, as outlined by the Turing School of Software and Design curriculum.  The objective of this project was to build a simulation of the popular board game "Battleship", to be played in a CLI.  The project demonstrates understanding of test-driven, object oriented programming principles.   

How to Play: 

In your CLI, clone the repository.  From within the parent directory of the repository, run the runner.rb using the command line.  The Linux or Mac command for this is `ruby runner.rb`.  At that point, you will see further instruction from within the console.
